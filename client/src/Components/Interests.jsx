        <p className="fs-5">
          I started doing Robotics in the fourth grade at a summer camp put on
          at my school where we got to come in and play with Lego Mindstorms all
          week. That summer camp set me on the course that led me to where I am
          today. I joined my schools FLL team the following year and continued
          on that team until High School. Once in High School I joined our FTC
          team and quickly rose through the ranks to become Head Programmer and
          Team Captain.

        <p className="fs-5 mb-5">
          Robotics introduced me to the world of Computer Science and
          programming, which I have since fallen in love with. It started me on
          the path that led me to Georgia Tech and I hope to continue to work in
          Robotics for a long time.

        <h3 className="mb-3 display-4 text-secondary">Music</h3>
        <p className="fs-5">
          I have always had a passion for music. Having participated in many
          school musicals and plays from a young age and through High School,
          and participating in the school orchestra as lead percussionist, music
          production has been a part of my life for a long time.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 mb-5">
          In college, I rediscovered my passiong for music production and
          started a band, Southbound, in which I am the lead singer, with a few
          of my friends and fraternity brothers. We now play at various shows
          and events throughout the year.

        <h3 className="mb-3 display-4 text-secondary">Eagle Scout</h3>
        <p className="fs-5">
          I spent seven years as a member of the Boy Scouts of America
          culminating in achieving the coveted rank of Eagle Scout in 2018.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5 mb-5">
          For my Eagle Scout Service Project, I designed, planned and oversaw
          the building of bat houses for Sandy Creek Nature Center in Athens,
          Georgia. I completed this project with a team of Boy Scouts whom I
          taught to assemble and hang the houses I designed.
