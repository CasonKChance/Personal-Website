          I am a fourth year student at Georgia Tech pursuing a major in
          Computer Science with threads in Artificial Intelligence and People. I
          am interested in software development, particularly full-stack
          development, robotics software, and Artificial Intelligence. I intend
          to graduate in the spring of 2024.
